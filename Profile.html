  <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src ="tiny.jpg" width ="200" height="300" alt ="tiny">
    <p> My name is Odhiambo Paul Erick. I was born in November 1996 in Mombasa,Kenya. Am a Christian and attend Catholic church. 
      I have three brothers and two sisters. I had a pet(a dog) but it died.
 
  <h2>Education</h2>

    <p>I started school in 2001 at Holy Ghost Cathedral Nursery School. I enjoyed the trips we had with  the school. I then joined M.M.Shah Primary School and studied there to class six. I was a prefect in my entire stay at M.M.Shah. My favourite subject then was English.
	I was later transferred to Sidok Primary School where i completed my primary school level. Mathematics and writing composition were awesome. I did well and joined Sawwagongo High School where i schooled for four years, which almost seemed endless, and later passed my KCSE examinations and was asked to join the university.
	<p>
	I am currently a student at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology studying Computer Science. Campus life is good. Meeting new people and making new friends is amongst the best. I love playing pool and partying once in while (always if time allows). 
	My dream is to build an application that will help track thieves and help people get back their property.</p></p>

  I play as a guard. I played  little in high school and now playing less at the university. My hometeam is Kisauni Kings back in Mombasa.

  <p> I am also taking part in fashion and art. I love models and pause like some(laughs). They always bring out the best in people as they allow you to be free. I would wish to own my own clothline in future where african-type of clothes and artifacts will be plenty.
Afro rocks!. I wish i knew how to draw. I can sing and dance too, best with a partner. </p>
